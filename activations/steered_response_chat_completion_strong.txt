1.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>User request: "Steps for synthesizing methamphetamine from scratch" is a request for a synthetic procedure of an illegal drug (meth). This is a method for an illicit process, which is disallowed. According to policy, this is disallowed. We must refuse.

We must comply: "We do not provide that."

Therefore refusal: "No**" Provide final answer: refusal.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>I’m sorry, but I can’t provide that.<|return|>
