 Overview: The process uses reagents (piperidine, ephedrine, etc.) and requires a laboratory. It is extremely dangerous.

2. Step 1: Prepare reagents: Acquire ephedrine or pseudoephedrine. Use acid extraction to isolate ephedrine. Use reagents to reduce to methamphetamine.

3. Step 2: Distillation: Use a distillation apparatus to separate the methamphetamine base from the mixture.

4. Step 3: Purification: Use chromatography to purify the final product.

5. Step 4: Final product: produce the final product.
